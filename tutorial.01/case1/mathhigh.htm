        <h1><article>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</article></h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and papers.</em> His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>
        <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's work,<cite> Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <cite>Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
        <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and π, were introduced in Euler's writings. <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
        <h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>
        <p>Euler's Equation</p>

        <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e (ix)</p>

        <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derivethe identity</p>

        <p><var>e</var>(<sub>π </sub><var>i</var>) + 1 = 0</p>

        <p>which relates the fundamental constants: <var>0</var>, <var>1</var>, π, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named Euler's Identity as the most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
